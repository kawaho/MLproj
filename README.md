# MLproj
A repo for my machine learning projects
## MNIST
A demo of a neural network that could assign uncertainties to its classification with the MNIST dataset based on [1].
## UNet
Similar to MNIST, apply [1] to a segmentation neural network, the famous UNet [2], on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset [3].
